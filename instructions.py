# Instructions to Set Up and Run the Project

# 1. Required Software:
#    - Python 3.9 or above.
#    - Jupyter Notebook: To install, use 'pip install notebook'.
#    - A code editor like Visual Studio Code (optional).

# 2. Required Python Libraries:
#    - pandas
#    - numpy
#    - matplotlib
#    - seaborn
#    - scikit-learn
#    - imbalanced-learn
#    - scipy

# Install the above libraries using pip:
# pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn scipy

# 3. How to Run the Jupyter Notebook:
#    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
#    - Navigate to the folder containing the Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., analysis.ipynb).
#    - Run the command: jupyter notebook
#    - This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser. Open the 'analysis.ipynb' file.

# 4. Data Requirements:
#    - Ensure that the dataset (e.g., cleaned_data.csv) is in the 'data/' directory as expected in the code.

# 5. Running the Code:
#    - Follow the cells sequentially to clean data, perform EDA, apply feature selection, balance the dataset,
#      train models, and visualize results.

# Below is a summarized Python script for key parts of the notebook. 
# For full functionality, refer to the Jupyter Notebook.
